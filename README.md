## Technology and tools

The list below contains all the main technologies I used to make this project. I decided to use them to practice some of the main tools and technologies used by large companies. They are not necessary, but each one speeds up the development process or makes it a little easier.

- <b>express</b> - Used to help with HTTP requests
- <b>sequelize</b> - Used to help with database handling
- <b>cors</b> - Used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- <b>dotenv</b> - Used to help use environment variables
- <b>mysql2</b> - Used by sequelize to handle the database
